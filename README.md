# Arduino Shift and Gear Indicator
Simple Arduino sketch to display telemetry data of racing-sims on a 8x WS2812 NeoPixel LED-Strip (RPM) and a basic 7-segment display
 (gear)
 
 Works in combination with https://github.com/Thomseeen/assetto-corsa-telemetry-router (Assetto Corsa and Assetto Corsa Competizione) and https://github.com/Billiam/pygauge (Dirt Rally, Dirt Rally 2 works but crashes on reverse as gears are interpreted slightly differently).

The Adafruit_NeoPixel library, necessary for this sketch to work, is available through the basic Arduino Library Manager.
